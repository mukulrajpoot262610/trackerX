# trackerX Web app

TrackerX is a Full-stack MERN Application for managing finances. I build this App for personal use, I was not able to find an app for managing finances which can fulfill my needs So, I decided to build my own ðŸ˜‹. User can track their expenses and income with various Filter Options. I used React-Bootstrap to build User Interface, Redux to manage state, Express for Backend API server, MongoDB Atlas as Database.
